    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>A hamburger is a food, typically considered a sandwich, consisting of one or more cooked patties—usually ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. </p>
    <p>The patty may be pan fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground lean (7% fat) beef</li>
        <li>A large egg</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>¼ cup fine dried bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire</li>
        <li>1 or 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>About 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>About 1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns (4 in. wide), split</li>
        <li>About 1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>About 1/4 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>4 iceberg lettuce leaves, rinsed and crisped</li>
        <li>1 firm-ripe tomato, cored and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 thin slices red onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix ground beef, egg, onion, bread crumbs, Worcestershire, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until well blended. Divide mixture into four equal portions and shape each into a patty about 4 inches wide.</li>
        <li>Lay burgers on an oiled barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook burgers, turning once, until browned on both sides and no longer pink inside (cut to test), 7 to 8 minutes total. Remove from grill.</li>
        <li>Lay buns, cut side down, on grill and cook until lightly toasted, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Spread mayonnaise and ketchup on bun bottoms. Add lettuce, tomato, burger, onion, and salt and pepper to taste. Set bun tops in place.</li>
    </ol>
